# Senior Research Project
 
# An Comparative Performance Analysis of React, Angular, and Vue.js

## Project Description

This project is a comparative performance analysis of the three leading front-end frameworks; React, Angular, and Vue.js. This research aims to evaluate their performance characteristics in the context of Single-Page Application (SPA) development.

## Objective

The primary objective of this research is to determine how React, Angular, and Vue.js compare in terms of performance metrics when used in a single-page application environment.
Key performance metrics include:

* **Load Time:** The time it takes for the application to initially load.
* **Memory Usage:** The amount of memory the application consumes. 
* **Rendering Speed:** The speed at which the application updates the user interface. 
* **Scalability:** The ability of the application to handle increasing complexity and data volume.
* **Overall Development Experience:** Personal assessment of the ease of use, learning curve, and development time for each framework.
